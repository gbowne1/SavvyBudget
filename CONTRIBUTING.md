# Contributing to SavvyBudget development

SavvyBudget is a full stack app centered around budget, finances, savings and expense management and bill tracking so that you can pay your bills on time and other things.

You can read more about it here [About this App](docs/ABOUT.md)

It uses PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node and JSX pages and components and a Material UI library.

We welcome Pull Requests (PR's) as well as having people working on fixing it's current issues. If you are coming to this project new, there is not much completed yet, but we welcome contributions which get us closer to the goal of releasing.

If you notice an issue with this app, please feel free to open an issue.

A lot of programmers, coders and developers prefer asking if they could contribute or be assigned a task as a reply to a reported issue in the Issues tab.  This is great.  We have a strict no gate-keeping policy in any of these projects.  You are welcome to work on any task/issue, just let us know that you are going to work on the an issue.  We also welcome first time contributions.

Typically, if you think it will take you longer than 72 hours (6 days) after having been assigned, to submit a PR, let us know if you won't be able to work on an issue so that way issues do not go stale and can be unassigned.

We welcome new contributors and those who are new to programming.  However, Some tasks may not be beginner friendly even if tagged `good first issue`.. so try and judge the task accordingly. If you are a beginner, there are smaller tasks a beginner can work on such as style issues.

You should already be familiar with React 17 and or 18, JavaScript ES5/ES6/ES7.  If you are not, there are resources for learning those.

At this time, We are looking for core contributors and active maintainers.

## Style

We would prefer the design be community driven.

## Development

If you are not sure what to work on, review the issues list.  There are also TODO's listed in the included [TODO.md](https://github.com/gbowne1/SavvyBudget/blob/main/TODO.md) file.

If you see anything missing from this, open an issue or a discussion.

- Testing

  We use React Testing Library and Jest to test AgiliZenti.  There are placed in the test directory.

### PR's

  When you do a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub, Please make sure you complete the section on the right, Assignees, Reviewers, Labels, Projects, Milestone(s) and Development before you submit the PR.  Please also share a screenshot or show the working fix in the Pull Request message and a brief description of what you fixed.  Blank issues and descriptions may not get merged.

- Link an issue to Development that the PR will close
- Make sure that you tag a reviewer i.e. @gbowne1
- Pick appropriate labels from Labels

## Issues

  When you create a Issue using the Issues tab on GitHub, Please make sure you complete the section on the right, Assignees, Reviewers, Labels, Projects, Milestone(s) and Development before you submit the PR.

  @gbowne1 will assign users to issues on a first come, first serve basis. If there we can assign specific groups of people taking care of things like CSS, Components, etc.

  If you believe you can fix the issue, let us know so that we can assign you to the issue.

## Editor & IDE

The repository contains folders with project appropriate settings and configurations for Visual Studio and Visual Studio code but beyond that, We are tool and editor/IDE agnostic so you can use whatever editor or IDE or you like.

## Settings & Configuration

The SavvyBudget project and @gbowne1 are editor/IDE agnostic.  Feel free to use whatever editor you like to contribute to this project.  Feel free to contribute settings for VSCode that may allow a new contributor who may not have their editor configuration done already.

We have recommended some intitial extensions through VSCode settings configuration.  You may choose not to install these if you like.

VSCode (.vscode)
GitHub (.github)

These may not be 100% correct, so if you can contribute to them to make them more accurate for React development it is welcomed.
